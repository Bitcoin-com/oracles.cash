## oracles.cash

[oracles.cash](https://oracles.cash) is a platform for creating Oracles on Bitcoin Cash.

Oracles allow outside information to be provided which can trigger execution in smart-contracts. Oracles.cash is a template for easily spinning up a backend to publish oracle data as well as an example of a Bitcoin Cash smart-contract which consumes data from the oracle service.

This was created for the [2019 WyoHackathon](https://wyohackathon.io)
