This directory contains integration tests. To run them requires that
a local copy of rest.bitcoin.com is running. The tests in this directory are
exactly the same calls that end users would use for their app to interact
directly with rest.bitcoin.com.

At present, this directory focuses on raw-transations. But more integration tests
will be added.
